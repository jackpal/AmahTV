# FAQ

Q: What is the purpose of this app?

A: This app provides an easy-to-use video viewing experience for users who are not comfortable with the full YouTube user interface. An example would be someone like my mother-in-law, who has never used a computer or a smart phone, but who is interested in watching a specific set of YouTube channels. When she uses the regular YouTube app, she is frustrated by the complicated user inteface. By simplifying the user interface, this app makes it easier for her to watch just the content she wants to.
